This is a small text based Adventure game that I made in Java. All parts of it are randomly generated, so it could go on indefinitly, though the monsters do scale faster than the player. 
Though the health and damage of each mmonster is random, they try to be fairly ballanced, so if it has more damage it has less health and vice versa.
The armor defence approaches an asymptote but is percent reduction so it will always be useful, and the weapons scale infinitely, but linearly.
